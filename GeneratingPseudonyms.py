# Project 1 : Generating Pseudonyms

"""In this project we will write a simple Python program that generates silly
names by randomly combining first names and surnames. With any luck, you’ll produce
a plethora of aliases that would make any sidekick proud. You’ll also review best­
practice coding guidelines and apply external programs that will help you write code
that conforms to those guidelines.
"""
"""
THE OBJECTIVE

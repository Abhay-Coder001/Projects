# Project 1 : Generating Pseudonyms

"""In this project we will write a simple Python program that generates silly
names by randomly combining first names and surnames. With any luck, you’ll produce
a plethora of aliases that would make any sidekick proud. You’ll also review best­
practice coding guidelines and apply external programs that will help you write code
that conforms to those guidelines.
"""
"""
THE OBJECTIVE
Randomly generate funny sidekick names using Python code that conforms
to established style guidelines.

The Strategy
You’ll start with two lists—first and last—of funny names. The lists will be relatively
short, so they won’t be memory intensive, won’t need to be dynamically updated, and
shouldn’t present any runtime issues.
